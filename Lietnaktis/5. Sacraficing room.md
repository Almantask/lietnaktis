You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes **1d8 necrotic damage**, and it **can’t regain hit points** until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.
